				<h1 class="text-center about-title">About Serbia</h1>
				<p>Republic of Serbia is sovereign country which is located on the crossroad of middle and southeastern Europe in the southern part of Pannonian Plain and in the center of peninsula. By most its part it grips Balcanian peninsula, and its smaller part grips Pannonian Plain. Serbian northern borders are with Hungary, northeastern are with Romania, eastern are with Bulgaria, southern are with North Macedonia, southwestern are with Albania and Montenegro, and western are with Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina (entity of Republica Srpska). Serbia without Kosovo and Metohia counts around 7 million people, and with Kosmet counts around 8.8 million people.</p>
                <p>When we think about Serbia, most of us already know quite a few things. Such as that Tesla was a Serb, that most Serbian last names end with the letters “ić”, and that the number one tennis player, Novak Djoković, comes from Serbia… But Serbia is a country that’s never ever short of surprises! Here are some little known facts about Serbia you probably never heard about.</p>
                <p>Between the 3rd and 4th century, a total of 18 Roman emperors were born on the soil of what is modern-day Serbia. That number accounts for a fifth of all Roman rulers.</p>
                <p>Those raspberriess you’re eating are Serbian! Serbia has been topping the global raspberry export list for several years now. In 2012, almost 95% of the world’s raspberries came from this country.</p>
                <p>“Vampir” is the most famous Serbian word that is accepted and used across the world. Furthermore, the first vampire wasn’t count Dracula but Petar Blagojević, about whose vampirism was extensively written about in the Austrian press in 1725.</p>
                <p>When people think about clocks we think about the Swiss. They’re wrong! They should be thinking about Serbs. The Serbian clock-making industry is older than the world-famous Swiss one. The Serbs had their own clock at least 200 years before the Swiss did.</p>
